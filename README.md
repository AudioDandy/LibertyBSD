# LibertyBSD
user manual for new LibertyBSD users
The goal of this document is to help new LibertyBSD users with installing en confuguring their new OS.
This document is not finished yet, we need some help with adding the steps needed to get the
Xfce Desktop Environment correctly installed on LibertBSD.

After this the steps to install the following software will be added:
- LibreOffice suite
- VLC mediaplayer
- Transmission bittorrent client (with GUI) 
- IceCat webbrowser? (would be great!)

If you help use with completing this document please download the last version of the document
and the info.
Thanks in advance!
