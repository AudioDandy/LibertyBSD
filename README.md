# LibertyBSD
User manual for new LibertyBSD users:

The goal of this document is to help new LibertyBSD users with installing en configuring their new OS.
This document is not finished yet, we need some help with adding the steps needed to get the
Xfce Desktop Environment correctly installed on LibertBSD.

After this the steps to install the following software will be added:
- LibreOffice suite
- VLC mediaplayer
- Transmission bit-torrent client (with GUI) 
- IceCat web-browser? (would be great!)

If you can help us with completing this document please download the last version of the document
and add the requested info. (and change the version number)

Thanks in advance!
